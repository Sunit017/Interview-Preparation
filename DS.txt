Data Structure =
===============

is a way organise and Storing the data efficiently .

ADT - Abstract Data Type 


nums [2,3,4,5,6,7] 
read opearation nums[3] =5 ; reading is easy because you give the index value , it directly jump to that value 

searching - you are searching for value not for index , so it is little bit difficult , here suppose you want to search for 5 , but your computer doesnot know about 5, it only knows aboy
memory address 

inserting - inserting elements in end is easy , because you first find the size of element then add in last , adding in middle is difficult because you can't directly add middle
what you have do means to move the element is create new block in end , move the second last element to last block then again move every element one by one 

deleting - deleting end is always easy , because it is not affecting array total , deleting paticular element from middle , you can't simple delete ,delete the end block and 
replace the value 


Problem - Searching an element in a sorted array ?

Solution - Linear Search , Binnary Search 

Linear Search -
